        <p>Today, I was named Sitecore Technology MVP 2018. Exactly 1 year after I was awarded the 2017 title.</p>
        
        <p>This is the reward obtained from continuous effort with and for the Sitecore community: Writing blog posts, helping others on Sitecore Slack and Sitecore Stack Exchange, organizing the Sitecore User Group Quebec, and contributing to open source modules.</p>
        
        <p>The nice part is that it is not that much effort. It is passion. It makes me happy to share my knowledge. I learn a lot from this involvement. It is fun because the Sitecore community is welcoming, inclusive, vibrant, and shares everything.</p>
        
        <p>A big thanks to the Sitecore community and all my friends who recommended me for the Sitecore MVP 2018 nomination.</p>
        
        <p>See you in Orlando!</p>
